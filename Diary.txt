Created React in frontend and Express in backend folders
Using yarn in both and each has their own yarn.lock and package.json files
git is set to the root folder MERN_Restaurant_App

===Next Step===
Add the React code to the frontend folder
Once that is there you can start with Traversy Section 3: Video 13, around the 6:40 mark
-it will involve getting the sample data from the front end and adding it to the backend

To start either the front or the backend you need to have a terminal open in the frontend or backend folder respectively
Then you run:
npx yarn start

Pulled the MERN_Restaurant_App repo into CodeSandbox
-was able to set up and see the backend on 5000 and the frontend on 3000

The React app on 3000 opens a new window in my browser
The Express app opens up in a Preview window

This split in locations was how it worked before but is unexpected
-it may make working on the app more complex I have multiple windows to manage
-it might be a good use of the portable monitor that I have

===Next Step===
Migrating the React code to this setup

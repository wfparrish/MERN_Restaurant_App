The whole project is starting to take shape. Tables can now be repositioned inside a sector.
I also added a new component, DraggableTableSquare, which is a table that can be dragged and dropped.
I also fixed a bug where the table was not being rendered if the position was undefined.

Next steps:
- Add a way to add/remove tables
- Add a way to select a table and see its details

The project happened faster than I expected, with piece of code immediately suggesting themselves as I was adding more features.
AI knew exactly what I was asking for and knew how to implement it. And since I knew the structure of what needed to be built once I started 
with the UI first (holding dummy data), I was able to build the project in a few hours.

At this point, we have the draggable tables working, and no errors in the Order calculations.

Much of the questions that were answered were answered by either the AI in codesandbox or ChatGPT.
This was started on 10/5/2024. This would have taken me a year to figure out on my own.

It is time to start building the backend. I should start with the Order model, and then move on to the Sector model.
I plan on using Express.js with Node.js. I'll have to research how to connect it to the frontend.

I also need to add a way to save the data to the backend. I think I'll create an endpoint for each model.

I also need to add a way to load the data from the backend. I'll have to figure out how to get the data from the database.
I'll probably have to create an endpoint for each model. And then I'll have to figure out how to display the data in the frontend.
MongoDB is probably the best choice for the database. And Mongoose would be the best choice for the ORM.

Is Axios the best choice when using React? I'll have to research it.

===Next Steps===
Review the Brad Traversy MERN Stack tutorial. Use his code as a reference to build the backend and connect it to the frontend.
The file system should mirror his setup, since I'll be using the same models/routes/controller boilerplate code. 

This is the stucture recommended by ChatGPT for the folder structure:
restaurant-app/
├── backend/
│   ├── controllers/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── routes/
│   ├── config/
│   ├── app.js
│   ├── package.json
│   └── .env
├── frontend/
│   ├── src/
│   ├── public/
│   ├── package.json
│   └── ... other React files
├── .gitignore
└── README.md

I want to see how close it matches the Traversy MERN Stack tutorial.
But to build an entire frontend in React in a week is mindblowing that I got it done. AI is truly changing the world.

The changes to the project are happening so fast I don't have a single source of truth for a Diary.txt file.
And there wasn't time to slow down and write every little change and problem to look up. AI solves so many problems so fast.
My job is to learn how to use AI to its fullest extent to build the project. And to look up things that are not related to AI.
Like the syntax of Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, etc. Or Vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. Because AI is translating my requests into 
React code without any errors. And now o1-mini just wrote an entire backend for me. models/routes/controllers/, Express server setup,
MongoDB connection, etc.

Created React in frontend and Express in backend folders
Using yarn in both and each has their own yarn.lock and package.json files
git is set to the root folder MERN_Restaurant_App

===Next Step===
Add the React code to the frontend folder
Once that is there you can start with Traversy Section 3: Video 13, around the 6:40 mark
-it will involve getting the sample data from the front end and adding it to the backend

To start either the front or the backend you need to have a terminal open in the frontend or backend folder respectively
Then you run:
npx yarn start

Pulled the MERN_Restaurant_App repo into CodeSandbox
-was able to set up and see the backend on 5000 and the frontend on 3000

The React app on 3000 opens a new window in my browser
The Express app opens up in a Preview window

This split in locations was how it worked before but is unexpected
-it may make working on the app more complex I have multiple windows to manage
-it might be a good use of the portable monitor that I have

Migrated the React code to this setup

===Next Step===
Set up the backend to serve the data to the front end
